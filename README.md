[![Release Status](https://github.com/log-10x/fluent-helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/log-10x/fluent-helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

Helm charts for deploying Fluentd / Fluent-Bit with an [10x Edge app](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/edge)

The Fluentd and Fluent-Bit charts are built on top of the official [fluent helm charts](https://github.com/fluent/helm-charts), and work by replacing the base image with one which has [10x installed](https://doc.log10x.com/install/linux/) on it, as well as setting all the necessary [10x configuration](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/)

For more details on how the images are created, see the [docker-images repo](https://github.com/log-10x/docker-images).

The supported [10x distributions](https://doc.log10x.com/architecture/flavors/) are JIT Edge and Native Edge. Check out each individual chart values.yaml for full configuration options.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use these charts; please refer to the _Helm_ [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

### OCI Repository (Recommended)

Install directly from the OCI registry:

```shell
# Install fluentd-10x
helm install fluentd oci://ghcr.io/log-10x/fluent-helm-charts/fluentd-10x

# Install a specific version
helm install fluentd oci://ghcr.io/log-10x/fluent-helm-charts/fluentd-10x --version 0.2.0

# Show chart info and available versions
helm show all oci://ghcr.io/log-10x/fluent-helm-charts/fluentd-10x
```

No `helm repo add` required - OCI pulls directly from the registry.
